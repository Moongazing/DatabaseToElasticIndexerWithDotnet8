ElasticSyncService

ElasticSyncService is a robust console application designed to synchronize data from a relational database (such as SQL Server) into an Elasticsearch index. Built for senior-level development practices, it provides an efficient solution for indexing and managing data within Elasticsearch, ensuring seamless data flow between a traditional RDBMS and Elasticsearch for high-performance search and analysis.
Features

Automated Index Creation: Automatically creates an index in Elasticsearch based on database table names if the specified index is not found.
Flexible Configuration: Uses an appsettings.json file for easy configuration of database connection strings, Elasticsearch URL, and index settings.
Efficient Data Transfer: Pulls data from the database in bulk and pushes it to Elasticsearch, minimizing the number of calls and optimizing data sync performance.
Error Handling: Provides detailed logs for failed sync attempts and error messages for easier debugging and monitoring.
Extensibility: Easily extendable to include more tables or additional data transformation logic before indexing.

Project Structure

 Program.cs: Main entry point for setting up configurations, initializing dependencies, and handling sync execution.
 SyncService.cs: Handles the core data synchronization process, pulling data from the database, and formatting it for Elasticsearch.
 ElasticsearchClient.cs: Manages the connection and requests to Elasticsearch, including error handling and response management.
 DbContext.cs: Entity Framework Core DbContext used to interact with the database and pull data for indexing.
 Models: Contains data models representing database entities for seamless mapping.

Usage

Clone the repository and open it in your preferred IDE.
Set up the database connection string and Elasticsearch URL in appsettings.json.
Run the application; it will fetch data from the database and index it to Elasticsearch.

Future Enhancements

Scheduled Sync: Implement scheduled synchronization to keep the Elasticsearch index up-to-date with database changes.
Additional Data Transformation: Allow for more complex data mapping and transformations before indexing.
Logging Enhancements: Integrate with centralized logging (e.g., Serilog or ELK stack) for better monitoring.
